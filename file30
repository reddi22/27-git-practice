Results should always be interpreted using the reference range provided by the laboratory that performed the test.
Different laboratories do tests using different technologies, methods and using different reagents which may cause difference
In reference ranges and hence it is recommended to interpret result with assay specific reference ranges provided in the reports.
To diagnose and monitor therapy doses, it is recommended to get tested every time at the same Laboratory.
